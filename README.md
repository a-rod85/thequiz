## Introduction


I wanted to do a quiz, based on different subjects. We all believe we have alot of knowledge
on anything and everything (including myslef). So why not create a game based on true or
false on different subjects.

## Project Goals



My goal for the site is to create a user friendly site for everybody who enjoys testing 
their knowledge on different topics. 
As mentioned its based on True or Flase each correct answer you will earn points based on
the difficulty level; easy = 25, medium = 50 & hard=100 points.

## Site Owner Goals

⊛ Have fun

⊛ User will want to get a top score

⊛ User will want to test themsleves with what they think they know

⊛ User will want to test themselves against friends and see who's better

## Design Choices
